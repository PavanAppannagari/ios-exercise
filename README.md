Create an iOS app that shows a list of cat breeds using this endpoint. Each row in the list shows the breed name, its popularity score,
what the breed is known for, and a thumbnail photo of a member of that breed. Users can optionally sort the list by breed name or popularity.

When the user taps a row, the app displays details about the breed. These details include the name of the breed, a larger photo of a 
member of the breed, the name of the photographer, a description of the breed and a button to show the breed's Wikipedia article in Safari.
